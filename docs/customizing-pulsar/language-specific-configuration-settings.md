title: Language-specific configuration settings

Some settings can be specified differently for different file types. For example, you may want Pulsar to soft-wrap Markdown files, use two-space tabs for Ruby files, and use four-space tabs for Python files.

Many of the settings in the `editor` namespace can be scoped to an editor’s language:

```
editor.autoIndent
editor.autoIndentOnPaste
editor.invisibles
editor.nonWordCharacters
editor.preferredLineLength
editor.scrollPastEnd
editor.showIndentGuide
editor.showInvisibles
editor.softWrap
editor.softWrapAtPreferredLineLength
editor.softWrapHangingIndent
editor.tabLength
```

## Language-specific settings in the settings view

The editor settings listed above can be customized in the {settings-view} UI. Open your settings, select the **Packages** pane, search for the language of your choice, and click on its **Settings** button.

## Language-specific settings in your config file

Most other language-specific settings cannot be configured in the UI, but you can still attempt to apply such overrides by editing your `config.cson` directly.

To open your `config.cson`, run the **Application: Open Your Config** setting or press <kbd class="platform-linux platform-win">Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd><kbd class="platform-mac">Cmd+Shift+P</kbd>.

Global settings are under the `*` key, and each language can have its own top-level key. This key is the language’s _scope_. Language-specific settings take precedence over anything set in the global section for that language only.

```coffee
'*': # all languages unless overridden
  'editor':
    'softWrap': false
    'tabLength': 8

'.source.gfm': # markdown overrides
  'editor':
    'softWrap': true

'.source.ruby': # ruby overrides
  'editor':
    'tabLength': 2

'.source.python': # python overrides
  'editor':
    'tabLength': 4
```

:::tip
When you save your `config.cson`, you might see its contents change slightly. For instance, the keys above will be “normalized” to `.gfm.source`, `.ruby.source`, and `.python.source` (with the segments of each scope ordered alphabetically). This is normal.

## Finding a language’s scope name

In order to write these overrides effectively, you'll need to know the scope name for the language.

One way to look this up is [an approach we’ve mentioned before](/customizing-pulsar/creating-your-own-snippets/#snippet-format). The scope name is shown in the settings view for each language. Click on "Packages" in the navigation on the left, search for the language of your choice, select it, and you should see the scope name under the language name heading:

![Finding a language grammar](/img/atom/python-grammar.png "Finding a grammar's scope name")

Another way to find the scope for a specific language is to open a file of its kind and <span class="platform-linux platform-win">choose **Editor: Log Cursor Scope** in the command palette</span><span class="platform-mac">press <kbd>Alt+Cmd+P</kbd></span> to show all scopes for the current position of the cursor. The first scope in the list is always the root language scope for this kind of file. Each subsequent scope in the list represents a progressively more specific region of the buffer.

These scopes can be especially useful to style the editor, since they can also be used as class names in your stylesheet.

## Can everything be overridden?

Technically, any setting can be specified to an arbitrary level of detail: not just by language, but using any scope selector of any complexity.

In practice, though, the onus falls on whatever is _consuming_ the setting to read it at the same level of specificity.

Suppose you set an override for a setting that is consumed by a package:

```coffee
'.source.python':
  'some-package':
    'some-setting': 4
```

For this override to be recognized, the `some-package` package would have to consider scope when reading `some-setting`. It may be written to read the setting only globally. It’s not easily possible for Pulsar to detect how the setting will be read in the future, so “can setting X be overridden?” isn’t a question that can be answered by Pulsar itself.

If you’re unsure if it will work, give it a try. If it doesn’t work, open an issue with the package’s author and politely request this feature.
