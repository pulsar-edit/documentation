Community packages extend, customize, and improve the features of Pulsar. The authors of community packages are part of the amazing community that makes Pulsar such a great editor.

There are few limits to what a package can do! If something can be done in Node _or_ in a web browser, it can be done in Pulsar, since Pulsar has access to _both_ of these ecosystems.

Most of the ways you can customize Pulsar can be bundled and distributed as a package. A typical package will perform exactly one of the tasks listed below, and occasionally may perform more than one:

* add a new user interface to Pulsar
* support another package by providing data to it (via a [service](/infrastructure/interacting-with-other-packages-via-services/))
* add a [syntax theme](../developing-a-theme/)
* add a [UI theme](../developing-a-theme/)
* add one or more [language grammars](../creating-a-grammar/)
