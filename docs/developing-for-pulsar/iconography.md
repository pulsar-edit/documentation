Pulsar comes bundled with the [Octicons 4.4.0](https://github.com/github/octicons/tree/v4.4.0)
icon set. Use them to add icons to your packages.

::: note
Some older icons from version `2.1.2` are still kept for backwards compatibility.

## Overview

In the {styleguide} under the “Icons” section you’ll find all the Octicons that are available. Invoke the **Styleguide: Show** command in the command palette.

## Usage

Octicons can be added with simple CSS classes in your markup. Prefix the icon names with `icon icon-`.

As an example, to add a monitor icon (`device-desktop`), use the `icon icon-device-desktop` classes:

```html
<span class="icon icon-device-desktop"></span>
```

## Size

Octicons look best with a `font-size` of `16px` — their default size. If you want a different size, try to use multiples of 16 (`32px`, `48px`, etc.) for the sharpest result. Sizes in between are OK, too, but might not look quite as sharp.

## Usability

Although an icon can make your UI visually appealing, when used without a text label, it can be hard to guess its meaning. In cases where space for a text label is insufficient, consider adding a tooltip that appears on hover via {TooltipManager} — an instance of which is always available at `atom.tooltips`.
