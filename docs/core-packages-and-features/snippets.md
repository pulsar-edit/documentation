Snippets are an incredibly powerful way to quickly generate repetitive text from a shortcut.

Snippets can be simple: type `habtm`, press [[Tab]], and see it expand into `has_and_belongs_to_many`.

Snippets can be more complex, too. In an HTML file, type `a`, press [[Tab]], and see it expand to

```html
<a href="#"></a>
```

with the `#` highlighted. After typing a URL, you can press [[Tab]] again to move to the area between the opening and closing tags. After typing some link text, press [[Tab]] a final time and you’ll see the cursor move past the closing `</a>`.

## What is a snippet?

At their simplest, snippets function like text macros. If you routinely put placeholder text into files, you could define a snippet that did nothing but insert a paragraph of “[Lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum)…” text.

But snippets also have advanced features that allow you to cycle through “slots” in generated text. Each slot can have fallback content, and slots can even act to “transform” input in simple ways.

## Triggering snippets

The simplest way to invoke a snippet is to give it a “prefix” — a unique string of text. Then, to trigger the snippet, type the trigger and press [[Tab]] (or invoke **Snippets: Expand**).

But there are two other ways to invoke snippets:

* The built-in {autocomplete-snippets} package will suggest snippets as you type. Selecting a snippet from the {autocomplete-plus} menu will trigger the snippet.
* A package can choose to give a snippet a unique command name instead of (or in addition to) a prefix. You can then invoke that command from the command palette or create a key binding for the command.

Many core and community packages come bundled with their own package-specific snippets. For example, the `language-html` package comes with dozens of snippets whose prefixes are the names of common HTML tags.

If you create a new HTML file in Pulsar, you can type `html` and press [[Tab]]. The `html` will be replaced with:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<title></title>
	</head>
	<body></body>
</html>
```

It will also position the cursor in the `lang` attribute value so you can edit it if necessary.

The “slots” that we mentioned earlier are more formally called **tab stops**. Many snippets have multiple tab stops that can be visited in order with the [[Tab]] key. For instance, in the case of this HTML snippet: after the cursor is placed in the `lang` attribute value, the next press of [[Tab]] will move the cursor to the `dir` attribute value; the next [[Tab]] will move it to the middle of the `title` tag; then one more [[Tab]] will finally move the cursor to the middle of the `body` tag.

To see all the available snippets for the context of your cursor, choose **Snippets: Available** in the Command Palette.

You can also use fuzzy search to filter this list down by typing in the selection box. Selecting one of them will execute the snippet where your cursor is (or multiple cursors are).

## Snippets for prose

There are also a number of great snippets available for writing Markdown quickly.

If you type `img` and hit [[Tab]] you get a Markdown-formatted image embed code like `![]()`. If you type `table` and hit [[Tab]] you get a nice example table to fill out.

```markdown
| Header One | Header Two |
| :--------- | :--------- |
| Item One   | Item Two   |
```

Although there are only a handful of Markdown snippets (`b` for bold, `i` for italic, `code` for a code block, etc), they save you from having to look up the more obscure syntaxes. Again, you can easily see a list of all available snippets for the type of file you’re currently in by choosing **Snippets: Available** in the command palette.

## Creating your own snippets

So that’s pretty cool, but what if there is something the language package didn’t include or something that is specific to the code you write? Luckily it’s [incredibly easy to add your own snippets](/customizing-pulsar/creating-your-own-snippets).
