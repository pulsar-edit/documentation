If you have packages installed that use native Node modules, when you upgrade to a new version of Pulsar, they might need to be rebuilt. When this happens, Pulsar detects it and, through the builtin {incompatible-packages} package, displays an indicator in the status bar.

![Incompatible Packages Status Bar Indicator](/img/atom/incompatible-packages-indicator.png "Incompatible Packages Status Bar Indicator")

If you see this indicator, click it and follow the instructions.
