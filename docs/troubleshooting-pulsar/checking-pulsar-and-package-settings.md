In some cases, unexpected behavior might be caused by settings in Pulsar or in one of the packages.

Open Pulsar’s settings view with <kbd class="platform-linux platform-win">Ctrl+,</kbd><kbd class="platform-mac">Cmd+,</kbd>, the <span class="platform-linux">_Edit > Preferences_</span><span class="platform-mac">_Pulsar > Settings…_</span><span class="platform-win">_File > Preferences_</span> menu option, or the **Settings View: Open** command from the command palette.

You can find a description of most common configuration options in the [Basic customization][] section. For example, if you want Pulsar to hide the invisible symbols representing whitespace characters, disable the "Show Invisibles" option.

Some of these options are also available on a per-language basis. For instance, you might want Python files to use hard tabs, but most other files to use soft tabs. To check the per-language settings, open the settings page for the language package that contains support for that language. For instance:

* JavaScript settings are inside the {language-javascript} package.
* Python settings are inside the {language-python} package.
* Both C and C++ settings are inside the {language-c} pacakge.

You can reach these settings pages via the Packages pane in the settings view.

<!-- TODO: Screenshot. -->

Other important settings aren’t present in the Core or Editor panes of the settings view because they’re provided by built-in packages. For instance, the vertical line you may see in the editor at around the 80-character mark is called the wrap guide, and it’s provided by the {wrap-guide} package. If you want to turn that line off, you can uncheck the “Enabled” option in the package settings, or else disable the package altogether.

:::tip

Why is there a separate “Enabled” setting if you can just disable the package? Because if the package is disabled, it can’t be used at all. An “Enabled” setting can be configured on a per-language basis.

And if you don’t like it when Pulsar strips trailing whitespace or ensures that there’s a single trailing newline in the file, you can configure that in the {whitespace} package’s settings.

How are you supposed to know which package contains which settings? You aren’t. That’s why Pulsar’s {settings-view} comes with a built-in search tool that can help you find the setting you’re looking for.
