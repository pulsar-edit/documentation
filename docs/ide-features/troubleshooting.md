IDE packages add more features to Pulsar, but they also introduce new possible points of failure. Here are a few techniques you can use to diagnose these failures.

## How do I figure out why something isn’t working?

IDE packages tend not to have interfaces, so troubleshooting can sometimes be tricky. The `README` file of the specific IDE package is the best place to start. Ideally, it should have:

* The name of the underlying language server and a link to its own documentation
* Information about the configuration options available for that package

### How failures happen

Here are a few things that could be going wrong:

1. As stated earlier, some language servers will have dependencies that are not included in the package itself. Re-read the documentation and make sure you’ve got everything installed that you need to, and that your IDE package can see whatever you’ve installed (in other words, make sure any new binaries you installed are in your `PATH`).

2. Sometimes a language server requires extra amounts of hand-holding or configuration. For instance, the `clangd` language server that powers {pulsar-ide-clangd} (for C/C++) wants to find [a file called `compile_commands.json`](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation#compile_commandsjson) somewhere within your project; this file is typically generated by your build system.

    Similarly, a language server might be a thin wrapper around other tools with their own conventions. One example is python’s `pylsp`; some of its features are enabled by default, but others require [opt-in via configuration](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration). If it feels like your IDE package isn’t providing as many features as it seems like it should, this may be one reason why.

3. Some IDE packages (especially older ones designed for Atom) may not be keeping up with their underlying language servers, and may be advertising fewer features than those language servers can support. If an IDE package hasn’t been updated in a while and you think it’s not being actively maintained, ask about it in one of our communities and we’ll take a look; it might just need a version bump or some new metadata!

### Using `symbols-view` as a guinea pig

Most language servers support symbol resolution, so the built-in {symbols-view} package has some tools that can often help you diagnose whether your language server is working properly.

::: warning

This won’t work with older IDE packages (the ones whose names start with `ide-`), since they were written before `symbols-view` had the ability to use other packages as data providers. But it should work with [any IDE package that provides the `symbol.provider` service](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages?serviceType=provided&service=symbol.provider).

:::

For instance: invoking a command called **Symbols View: Show Active Providers** will display a notification with a list of all known symbol providers, along with the packages that provide them.

![Symbols View providers list](/img/atom/symbols-view-providers.png)

Two of these providers, **ctags** and **Tree-sitter**, are built into Pulsar. The others in the list are provided by community packages and IDE packages in particular. If you don’t see your IDE package in this list, there’s a good chance it’s failing to start properly; read below.

If your package is listed in the notification, you can go to the `symbols-view` settings and select the **Show Provider Names In Symbols View** setting. This will add a badge onto palette items in symbols lists that shows the source of the symbol.

![provider names in symbols-view](/img/atom/symbols-view-provider-names.png)

If an IDE package is providing symbols, it’s typically regarded as a better source of information than the built-in symbol providers. So if it’s working properly, you should expect it to “win” over such providers.

## What if I just want to look at logs?

You should [open your developer tools](/troubleshooting-pulsar/checking-for-errors-in-developer-tools/) and look through the console for any errors related to your package. If the package fails to activate, there will typically be a message indicating it.

If the package seems to activate properly — for instance, if you can view its package settings page — then the underlying language server is probably failing to start up. Language servers launch in a separate process from Pulsar; if that launch process fails for whatever reason, the “brain” of the IDE package will be absent.

Luckily, all IDE packages based on `atom-languageclient` have a hidden logging mode. You can enable it by opening your developer tools, focusing the Console tab, and executing this JavaScript:

```js
atom.config.set('core.debugLSP', true);
```

Once you change this setting, reload your window via the **Window: Reload** command. Open developer tools again and you should see some new log lines. Each language-server–related log message should be annotated with the name of the server, and you should even be able to filter on that name to look at the output from one specific IDE package:

![IDE package log output](/img/atom/ide-log-output.png)

Here you can see all the ways that the IDE package (the language client) is communicating with the language server. If something is going wrong during startup, this logging should make it easier to identify the root cause.

When you’re done drinking from the firehose, you can disable the debug logging and reload your window once again:

```js
atom.config.set('core.debugLSP', false);
```
