Out of the box, Pulsar is an excellent and versatile code editor. But it’s also capable of being a deeply _wise_ code editor for a number of different languages.

If your favorite language has a [_language server_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol) — a tool designed to support common editor tasks for that language — then Pulsar can embrace that language server in order to improve your editing experience by adding a number of features.

We call these **IDE features** because they’re the kinds of features you typically get in a single-purpose [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) than from a general-purpose code editor:

  * [Autocompletion](/ide-features/builtin-packages/#autocompletion)
  * [Project-wide symbol search and “Jump to declaration” functionality](/ide-features/builtin-packages/#symbol-resolution)
  * [Linting and code diagnostics](/ide-features/community-packages/#linting)
  * [Identifying and highlighting references](/ide-features/community-packages/#highlighting-references)
  * Refactoring (for example, [renaming a method project-wide](/ide-features/community-packages/#renaming-symbols))
  * [A hierarchical outline of the current file](/ide-features/community-packages/#hierarchical-outline)
  * [Rich information on hover](/ide-features/community-packages/#hover-information), like method signatures and links to documentation
