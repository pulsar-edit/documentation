This section is all about how to start using Pulsar, such as how to install it and how to use it for basic text editing.

But before diving into the documentation, it's helpful to go over some aspects of how the documentation is written.

Throughout the documentation, we will refer to platform-specific keybindings, file system locations, and menu items. We make a guess as to what your platform might be. If we’ve guessed wrong, you can use the platform switcher at the top of each page to change these values to the right ones for your platform.

If you have customized your Pulsar keymap, you can always see the keybinding you have mapped in the Command Palette or the Keybindings tab in [Settings View](TODO).
